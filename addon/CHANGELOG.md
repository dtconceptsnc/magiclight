**Bug Fix - Light Designer Interface**

**Bug Fixes:**

## 4.0.7
**Simplification - Remove Recall Offset Concept**

**BREAKING**: Removed dual offset system for simplified state management

- Offsets are preserved in `magic_mode_time_offsets` whether magic mode is on or off
- No more automatic saving/restoring of offsets when toggling magic mode
- Removed file I/O for `saved_offsets.json`

**Improvements:**
- Simplified offset management - step adjustments persist across magic mode toggles
- More predictable behavior - offsets don't get lost when disabling/enabling magic mode
- Cleaner codebase - removed ~50 lines of save/restore logic
- Better user experience - manual adjustments are preserved

**Technical Changes:**
- Removed `recall_time_offsets` dictionary and related methods
- Simplified `enable_magic_mode()` and `disable_magic_mode()` method signatures

## 4.0.6
**Bug Fix - UI/Backend Time Synchronization**

**Bug Fixes:**

- UI now fetches server time from Home Assistant instead of using browser time
- Resolved issue where UI showed different lighting values than backend would apply
- Fixed curve visualization to use clock time consistently across all API endpoints
- Fixed step calculation markers to align with corrected curve data

**Technical Details:**
- Added `/api/time` endpoint to provide server time in Home Assistant timezone
- Updated curve generation (`/api/curve`) to use clock time instead of mixing solar/clock time
- Fixed step sequences (`/api/steps`) to interpret input as clock time
